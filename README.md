# Bullet-Maze (Nekomatata Game Jam #150)
**Game Jam Theme:** _You're the Enemy_

Play as a legally distinct pellet-eating ghostbuster who is definitely not Pac-Man, where the pellets are your bullets. Turns out not-Pac-Man is kind of a dick towards ghosts.

Loosely based on Tom Francis' [Tutorial Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2OGes1-b6E).

Playable at: TBC
