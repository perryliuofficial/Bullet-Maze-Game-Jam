# Bullet-Maze (Weekly Game Jam #150)
**Game Jam Theme:** _[You're the Enemy](https://itch.io/jam/weekly-game-jam-150)_

Play as a legally distinct pellet-eating ghostbuster who is definitely not Pac-Man, where the pellets are your bullets. Turns out not-Pac-Man is kind of a dick towards ghosts. #PacMan40th
